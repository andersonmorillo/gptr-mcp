## Why GPT Researcher MCP?

While LLM apps can access web search tools with MCP, **GPT Researcher MCP delivers deep research results.** Standard search tools return raw results requiring manual filtering, often containing irrelevant sources and wasting context window space.

GPT Researcher autonomously explores and validates numerous sources, focusing only on relevant, trusted and up-to-date information. Though slightly slower than standard search (~30 seconds wait), it delivers:

- ‚ú® Higher quality information
- üìä Optimized context usage
- üîé Comprehensive results
- üß† Better reasoning for LLMs

## Prerequisites

Before running the MCP server, make sure you have:

1. Python 3.11 or higher installed
   - **Important**: GPT Researcher >=0.12.16 requires Python 3.11+
2. API keys for the services you plan to use:
   - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - [Tavily API key](https://app.tavily.com)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the GPT Researcher repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher.git
cd gpt-researcher
```

2. Install the gptr-mcp dependencies:
```bash
cd gptr-mcp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to create a new file named `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys and configure other settings:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
   ```
You can also add any other env variable for your GPT Researcher configuration.

## üöÄ Running the MCP Server

You can run the MCP server in several ways:

### Method 1: Directly using Python

```bash
python server.py
```

### Method 2: Using the MCP CLI (if installed)

```bash
mcp run server.py
```

### Method 3: Using Docker (recommended for production)

#### Option A: Standalone Mode

This is the simplest way to run the server if you don't need to connect to other containers:

```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml up -d

# Or manually:
docker build -t gpt-mcp-server .
docker run -d \
  --name gpt-mcp-server \
  -p 8006:8006 \
  --env-file .env \
  gpt-mcp-server
```

#### Option B: With Network for n8n Integration

If you need to connect to other services like n8n on the same network:

```bash
# Create the network if it doesn't exist
docker network create n8n-mcp-net

# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or manually:
docker build -t gpt-mcp-server .
docker run -d \
  --name gpt-mcp-server \
  --network n8n-mcp-net \
  -p 8006:8006 \
  --env-file .env \
  gpt-mcp-server
```

**Note**: The Docker image uses Python 3.11 to meet the requirements of gpt-researcher >=0.12.16. If you encounter errors during the build, ensure you're using the latest Dockerfile from this repository.

Once the server is running, you'll see output indicating that the server is ready to accept connections. You can verify it's working by:

1. Accessing the OpenAPI docs at http://localhost:8006/docs
2. Testing the MCP endpoint at http://localhost:8006/mcp

## Integrating with Claude

You can integrate your MCP server with Claude using:

**[Claude Desktop Integration](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/mcp-server/claude-integration)** - For using with Claude desktop application on Mac

For detailed instructions, follow the link above.

## üíª Claude Desktop Integration

To integrate your locally running MCP server with Claude for Mac, you'll need to:

1. Make sure the MCP server is installed and running
2. Configure Claude Desktop:
   - Locate or create the configuration file at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Add your local GPT Researcher MCP server to the configuration
   - Restart Claude to apply the configuration

For complete step-by-step instructions, see the [Claude Desktop Integration guide](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/mcp-server/claude-integration).

## üìù Example Usage with Claude

```
User: I'm considering investing in NVIDIA. Can you research the current state of the company, recent stock performance, latest product announcements, and analyst opinions?

Claude: I'll help you research NVIDIA for investment purposes. This will take a moment as I conduct comprehensive research to find the most up-to-date information about their stock performance, recent developments, and expert analysis.

[Claude uses conduct_research tool - this takes 30-40 seconds]

Claude: Based on my research, here's a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA's current state:

```

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the MCP server:

1. Make sure your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
2. Check that you're using Python 3.11 or higher (required by gpt-researcher >=0.12.16)
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Check the server logs for error messages

If you're running with Docker and experiencing issues:

1. Verify the container is running: `docker ps | grep gpt-mcp-server`
2. Check container logs: `docker logs gpt-mcp-server`
3. Confirm the server is binding to all interfaces - logs should show listening on 0.0.0.0:8006
4. If you see dependency errors during build:
   - Ensure you're using the updated Dockerfile with Python 3.11
   - Try rebuilding with the `--no-cache` flag: `docker build --no-cache -t gpt-mcp-server .`
   - Check the version of gpt-researcher in your requirements.txt matches the Python version

For local installation issues:
```bash
# Check your Python version (must be 3.11+)
python --version

# Update pip to the latest version
pip install --upgrade pip

# If you're using a virtual environment, create a new one with Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
